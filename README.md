# Ethereum-Price-Predictor


# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency data, focusing on historical price trends and associated market indicators. It aims to provide insights into the price dynamics, trading volumes, and potential correlations within the dataset.

## Who is it for?

- **Crypto Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in understanding historical price movements and trends of Ethereum for investment or informational purposes.

- **Data Analysts and Researchers:** Professionals or researchers in the field of data analysis who want to explore and visualize cryptocurrency market data.

- **Developers:** Those looking for a practical example of using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization within the context of cryptocurrency data.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading:** The project demonstrates how to load cryptocurrency data from a CSV file (e.g., 'ETH-USD.csv') using the pandas library.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps are employed to analyze the distribution, outliers, and correlations among various features like open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.

- **Data Manipulation:** Techniques like datetime conversion, feature engineering (creating new columns), and calculating target variables are illustrated.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Basic statistical summaries and group-wise means are used to understand the overall trends and patterns in the dataset.

- **Machine Learning Aspect:** The project includes a basic example of creating a target variable for machine learning purposes, where the goal is to predict whether the cryptocurrency price will increase or decrease in the next time step.

## How to Use

- Follow the installation instructions in the README to set up the project environment.
- Execute the provided Python scripts to perform data analysis and visualize key aspects of Ethereum's historical price data.
